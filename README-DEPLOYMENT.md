# BlockVerse Deployment - Choose Your Path

Quick guide to help you pick the right deployment method.

## üö® Important: Why Not Vercel?

You originally asked to deploy to Vercel, but **Vercel won't work** for BlockVerse because:
- Your app uses **Socket.io** for multiplayer (needs persistent WebSocket connections)
- Vercel uses **serverless functions** (incompatible with persistent connections)
- Your multiplayer game would break on Vercel

**Solution:** Use one of the platforms below that support WebSockets ‚úÖ
